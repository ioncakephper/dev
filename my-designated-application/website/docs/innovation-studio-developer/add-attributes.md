# Add Attributes

To add an attribute, in the UI designer, select one of the vertical or horizontal attribute templates and drag it to the white panel. It is possible to add attribute and their label vertically or horizontally.

From the drop-down on the right side of the screen:

1. Select the desired attribute.
2. Select what text does the label display:

   * **`Default`** - leaves the label as the display name of the attribute.
   * **`Custom`** - allows you to manually enter the text for the label. There is also the option to manually add the text that is displayed for each language added in the platform, by clicking the toggle translation button placed in the Enter the desired text field. Choose a name for the resource key that will save this text in the Localization Resources page.

3. Click **Apply** changes to save your configuration.

4. Click **Update template** to save your changes and then click **Save and reload**.
